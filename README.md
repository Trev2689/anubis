This is a directory structure for utilizng the argocd app of apps pattern to bootstrap eks clusters with 'core' applications alongside instances of vault. The idea here is that once argocd is installed, the app-of-apps.yaml in the 'argocd-bootstrap' folder gets applied. This app-of-apps is set to read everything in the 'argocd-applications' directory which is two 'Applicationsets' one for core and one for vault. The end result is a fully set up eks cluster, a single source of truth, to allow for declaritive changes in source code following gitops best practices. To add more to either 'core' or 'vault' simply commit to the repo following the conventions and their respective applicationsets will handle rollout. Similarly to remove simply remove all traces from this repo. To clear everything, remove the respective applicationsets and application(app-of-apps.yaml) from the cluster.
